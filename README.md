# CRM System
Project for the [PIS](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/PIS/.cs) course at BUT FIT.

# Developing the application

To work on the API, first make sure `docker` service is running. Then enter the following commands to create and start a container running in development mode, so that it listens for any changes in the application source code or configuration and rebuilds the image and restarts the container as necessary.

```
cd api/
mvn libery:devc
```

# Building the application
**TODO:** Create a docker-compose file for building the application.
